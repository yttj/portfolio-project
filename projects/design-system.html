      <h4>Design principles</h4>
      <p>A Design System is a set of interconnected patterns and shared practices coherently organized. Design Systems aid in digital product design and development of products such as apps or websites. They may contain, but are not limited to, pattern libraries, design languages, style guides, coded components, brand languages, and documentation.</p>
      <p>It serves as a reference or source of truth that helps the different teams involved (such as designers, developers, copywriters and project managers) to design and build digital products.</p>
      <p>Notable design systems include Lightning Design System (by Salesforce), Material Design (by Google), Carbon Design System (by IBM), and Fluent Design System (by Microsoft).</p></div>

        <p>This is what body copy looks like. Strategic design means designing for a specific objective. More often than not, that objective is growing a business. But it’s important to recognize that there’s a difference between being strategic by being the conduit between the business and the user, and designing for the business alone.</p>

                <p class="text-white">My partner's fear is about his own experience. My partner became even more depressed in high school because of his boring lifestyle. So now he enjoys life as much as possible and does what he likes to do. His fear now comes from life. He is afraid that entering college will prevent him from doing what he likes to do. So as his friend, I hope my video can help him.</p>

                <p class="text-white">"Therefore, in modern times, the mask is more like an art. People are committed to using different materials and methods to make masks. Some artists use fabrics to make masks, some artists use modern 3D printing techniques to make masks, and some artists use thermoplastic materials to make masks. In my opinion, this is very different from the historical mask."</p>
